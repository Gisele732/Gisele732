- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gisele732
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new skills and changing career path! I'm a coffee roaster looking to switch to the booming and exciting IT industry. 
-   I've just started learning so don't ask me any hard question and please be patient :).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, HTML, CSS via The Odin Project and a NZ Diploma in Web development and design with the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, give me a few months to get my head around things and understand what the hell is happening.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at annelise.mornard@gmail.com
